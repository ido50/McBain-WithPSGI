=head1 NAME
 
McBain::WithPSGI - Load a McBain API as a RESTful PSGI web service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# write your API as you normally would, and create
	# a simple psgi file:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w

	use warnings;
	use strict;
	use MyAPI -withPSGI;

	my $app = MyAPI->to_app;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<McBain::WithPSGI> turns your L<McBain> API into a RESTful L<PSGI> web service based on
L<Plack>, thus making C<McBain> a web application framework.

The created web service will be a JSON-in JSON-out service. Requests to your application
are expected to have a C<Content-Type> of C<application/json; charset=UTF-8>. The JSON body
of a request will be the payload. The results of the API will be formatted into JSON as
well.

Note that if an API method does not return a hash-ref, this runner module will automatically
turn it into a hash-ref to ensure that conversion into JSON will be possible. The created
hash-ref will have one key - holding the method's name, with whatever was returned from the
method as its value. For example, if method C<GET:/divide> in topic C</math> returns an
integer (say 7), then the client will get the JSON C<{ "GET:/math/divide": 7 }>.

=head2 SUPPORTED HTTP METHODS

This runner support all methods natively supported by L<McBain>. That is: C<GET>, C<PUT>,
C<POST>, C<DELETE> and C<OPTIONS>. To add support for C<HEAD> requests, use L<Plack::Middleware::Head>.

The C<OPTIONS> method is special. It returns a list of all HTTP methods allowed by a specific
route (in the C<Allow> header). The response body will be the same hash-ref returned by
C<McBain> for C<OPTIONS> requests, JSON encoded.

=head2 CAVEATS AND CONSIDERATIONS

The C<HTTP> protocol does not allow C<GET> requests to have content, so your C<GET> routes will
not be able to receive parameters from a request's JSON body as all other methods do.
If your get requests I<must> get parameters (for example, a route that returns a list of objects
with support for pagination), C<McBain::WithPSGI> supports parameters from the query string. They
will be validated like all parameters, and they can be used in non-C<GET> requests too. Note that
they take precedence over body parameters.

The downside to this is that the parameters cannot be complex structures, though if the query string
defines a certain key several times, its generated value will be an array reference. For example,
let's look at the following route:

	get '/params_from_query' => (
		params => {
			some_string => { required => 1 },
			some_array => { array => 1, min_length => 2 }
		},
		cb => sub {
			my ($api, $params) = @_;
			return $params;
		}
	);

This route isn't particularly interesting, as it simply returns the parameters it receives. It does,
however, enforces the existance of the C<some_string> parameter, and expects C<some_array> to be an
array reference of at least 2 items. A request to C</params_from_query?some_string=this_is_my_string&some_array=Hello&some_array=World> will yield the
following result:

	{ some_string => 'this_is_my_string', some_array => ['Hello', 'World'] }

=head1 METHODS EXPORTED TO YOUR API

None.

=head1 METHODS REQUIRED BY MCBAIN

=head2 init( $target )

Makes the root topic of your API inherit L<Plack::Component>, so that it
officially becomes a Plack app. This will provide your API with the C<to_app()>
method.

=cut

sub init {
	my ($class, $target) = @_;

	if ($target->is_root) {
		no strict 'refs';
		push(@{"${target}::ISA"}, 'Plack::Component');
	}
}

=head2 generate_env( $psgi_env )

Receives the PSGI env hash-ref and creates McBain's standard env hash-ref
from it.

=cut

sub generate_env {
	my ($self, $psgi_env) = @_;

	my $req = Plack::Request->new($psgi_env);

	my $payload = $req->content ? $json->decode($req->content) : {};

	# also take parameters from query string, if any
	# and let them have precedence over request content
	my $query = $req->query_parameters->mixed;
	foreach (keys %$query) {
		$payload->{$_} = $query->{$_};
	}

	return {
		METHOD	=> $req->method,
		ROUTE		=> $req->path,
		PAYLOAD	=> $payload
	};
}

=head2 generate_res( $env, $res )

Converts the result of an API method to JSON, and returns a standard PSGI
response array-ref.

=cut

sub generate_res {
	my ($self, $env, $res) = @_;

	my @headers = ('Content-Type' => 'application/json; charset=UTF-8');

	if ($env->{METHOD} eq 'OPTIONS') {
		push(@headers, 'Allow' => join(',', keys %$res));
	}

	$res = { $env->{METHOD}.':'.$env->{ROUTE} => $res }
		unless ref $res eq 'HASH';

	return [200, \@headers, [$json->encode($res)]];
}

=head2 handle_exception( $err )

Formats exceptions into JSON and returns a standard PSGI array-ref.

=cut

sub handle_exception {
	my ($class, $err) = @_;

	return [delete($err->{code}), ['Content-Type' => 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'], [$json->encode($err)]];
}
